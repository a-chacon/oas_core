# LLMs Documentation (llms.txt)

OasCore generates `.txt` files optimized for AI integration:

- [llms.txt](/oas_core/llms.txt): Provides the basics to understand the structure and functionality of OasCore. (Work in progress)
- [llms-full.txt](/oas_core/llms-full.txt): Offers a full description of how to use OasCore and document endpoints. (**Currently recommended**)

## How It Works (in 3 Steps)

### 1. Choose the File

OasCore generates `.txt` files optimized for AI tools.

### 2. Load It Into Your Tool

You can load these files into any AI tool or editor that supports external context. For this example, I used Cursor. **This is not a tool I recommend** because it is closed-source, but it worked for the example.

### 3. Ask Questions Naturally

Examples of questions you can ask:

- *"How to document JWT authentication in OasCore?"*  
- *"Document the endpoint..."*  
- *"Add examples of possible request bodies for the create method."*
