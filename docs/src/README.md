# Introduction

OasCore is a Ruby gem designed to generate Open API Specification (OAS) 3.1 documentation directly from YARD comments in your endpoints. It serves as the core engine for OAS generation, while framework-specific adapters like `OasRails` (for Ruby on Rails) handle the extraction, integration and additional features.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **OAS 3.1 Generation**: OasCore generates OAS version 3.1, the latest standard, ensuring your API documentation is up-to-date.

- 📝 **YARD-Powered Documentation**: Simply annotate your endpoints with YARD tags to include descriptions, parameters, and examples—no need to learn a new DSL or rely on framework-specific tools.

- 🔌 **Framework Agnostic**: OasCore is designed to work with any Ruby framework. Adapters like `OasRails` extend its functionality for specific frameworks.
